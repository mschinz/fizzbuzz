An introduction to F#

## Problem

Write a function that given an input integer in the range of 1 to 100 (inclusive) returns the following:

* If the number is divisible by 3 it should return "fizz" (without quotes).
* If the number is divisible by 5 it should return "buzz".
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should return "fizzbuzz".
* If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5 it should return the number as a string.

This should be implemented in a test driven way ( validating input and each case separately )
After each test the code ( and test code ) should be examined for opportunities to refactor.
